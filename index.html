        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what
          had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
          except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his
          house, his fruit--of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
          him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieceâ€™s beginning the subject.</p>
